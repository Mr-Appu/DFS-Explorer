# DFS Explorer: Visualize the search algorithm

A tool for visualizing the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm on graphs.

### Features
* Add nodes and edges to a graph
* Clear the graph
* Visualize the DFS traversal as it happens

### Usage
* Run the app: python DFS_Explorer.py
* Use the mouse to add nodes and edges to the graph.
* Press Number "1" button in keyboard to start the DFS traversal. The traversal will be visualized on the canvas.
* Starting node for DFS traversal is 1.

### Future Improvements
* Add support for other graph traversal algorithms, such as breadth-first search (BFS) or topological sort.
* Implement a feature that allows the user to save and load their graphs.
* Implement a feature that allows the user to apply transformations to the graph, such as reversing edges or adding weights to edges.

### Dependencies
* Python 3.6 or higher
* Tkinter

### Bugs 
* Feel free to report bugs, either in code itself or in algorithm.
